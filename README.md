#Traffix
Traffix is a Windows Phone application that was originally developed for Windows Phone 7 and has been upgraded to run on Windows Phone 8, although it still contains the use of deprecated APIs. Traffix is a Windows Phone 7 application ported to Windows Phone 8 that uses a few GIS capabilities related to traffic data.

###What is Traffix?
Traffix uses several rest services to reverse geocode a location to acquire from an IP Address. This location is then used to query for traffic data (construction, accidents, etc.) and displays them as points on a map. Traffix also allows different tile providers for the map.

_NOTE:Traffix was designed as an example application and the code is meant as a teaching tool. Use otherwise at your own risk._
